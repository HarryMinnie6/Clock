https://harryminnie6.github.io/Clock/

This was one of my first JavaScript projects. The page displays analog time, digital time as well as the current date. 
My my focus for this project was the JavaScript, as to get a better understanding of it.

Analog and Digital clock, date is also added.

Majority of the Css was not created by myself, my main focus was the JavaScript.
